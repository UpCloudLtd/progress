# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Do not output `ProgressMessage` to non-interactive terminals. This avoids including a progress update in the started message that is printed to non-interactive terminals.

## [v1.0.2] - 2022-11-23

### Fixed

- Normalise whitespace (`\s` â†’ ` `) in messages to avoid newlines and tabs breaking in-progress message updating.
- Assume details message to be preformatted, if it contains newline characters (`\n`). Preformatted message details are wrapped so that newline characters are maintained. This makes, for example, stack traces and console output in message details more readable.

## [v1.0.1] - 2022-08-30

### Fixed

- Do not try to render message if terminal width is zero. This happens with some terminals on first terminal width get(s).

## [v1.0.0] - 2022-08-26

### Added

- Extract and refactor livelog functionality from [UpCloud CLI (`upctl`)](https://github.com/UpCloudLtd/upcloud-cli.git).
